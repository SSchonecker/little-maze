# Notes on the database

The database is not included in this project. There would probably be an option using docker containers to get one in, but I have not put in the time to include it (yet).

To set up your own, a bit of guidance is given in the DB-setup commands. Don't forget to grant the right user privileges and adjust the connection parameters in SQLConnect if necessary.

Also, to change the port, all MazeXXX files linking to the SQLConnect need to be updated.
